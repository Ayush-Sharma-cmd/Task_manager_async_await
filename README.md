# Task_manager_async_await
This Task Manager app lets users add, view, edit, and delete tasks using a clean interface. All tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence. The app uses async/await to handle data flow in a clean and readable way. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fully supported.
